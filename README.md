# Coffee Shop Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves the creation of an advanced Power BI dashboard for a coffee shop, utilizing a MySQL database as the data source. The primary goal of the dashboard is to provide comprehensive insights into various business metrics such as total sales, orders, and quantities sold. By leveraging advanced DAX queries, the dashboard delivers actionable insights that aid in effective business decision-making.

## Features
- **Advanced Dashboard:** Created a sophisticated Power BI dashboard that combines multiple visualizations to offer a comprehensive view of business metrics.
- **Data Source:** Integrated a MySQL database for storing and managing the coffee shop's data. Advanced DAX queries were employed to manipulate and analyze the data.
- **KPIs:**
  - **Total Sales Analysis:** This KPI displays the total sales for the selected period. It also includes month-on-month changes and calculates the difference between current and previous month sales, helping to identify trends and patterns in sales performance.
  - **Total Order Analysis:** This KPI shows the total number of orders placed within the selected timeframe. It tracks month-on-month changes and calculates the difference between current and previous month orders, providing insights into customer purchasing behavior.
  - **Total Quantity Analysis:** This KPI presents the total quantity of products sold. It includes month-on-month changes and calculates the difference between current and previous month quantities, aiding in inventory management and sales forecasting.
- **Filters and Visualizations:**
  - **Month Filter Slicers:** Implemented slicers to filter the data by month, allowing for dynamic and focused analysis of specific time periods.
  - **Calendar Heat Map:** Created a calendar heat map with tooltips to provide detailed daily sales insights, making it easy to identify peak sales days and seasonal trends.
  - **Weekend vs. Weekday Sales:** Developed a donut chart to visualize the distribution of sales between weekends and weekdays, offering insights into customer purchasing patterns.
  - **Top 10 Products:** Highlighted the top 10 products in terms of sales with a bar chart, helping to identify best-selling items.
  - **Trend Analysis:** Conducted trend analysis using a bar chart combined with an average sales line, providing a clear view of sales performance over time.
  - **Hourly Sales Heat Map:** Designed a heat map showing sales for each hour of the day, offering detailed temporal analysis to understand peak sales times.

## Usage
- **Sales Analysis:** Use the dashboard to track and analyze total sales. Monitor month-on-month changes and compare current sales with previous months to identify trends and make data-driven decisions.
- **Order Analysis:** Evaluate total orders and observe month-on-month changes. Compare current orders with previous months to gain insights into customer purchasing behavior and adjust marketing strategies accordingly.
- **Quantity Analysis:** Assess the total quantity of products sold. Monitor month-on-month changes and compare current quantities with previous months to improve inventory management and sales forecasting.
- **Dynamic Filtering:** Utilize the slicers to filter data by month for targeted analysis. This allows for focused insights into specific time periods and helps in understanding seasonal trends.
- **Detailed Insights:** Leverage the calendar heat map, donut chart, bar charts, and heat maps to gain detailed insights into daily sales, top products, trend analysis, and hourly sales patterns.
